        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I grew up in Hamilton Ohio where I graduated form Hamilton High School before attending Miami University where I studied Psycological Science with a focus on family realtionships and dynamics.
            While attending college, I had the opportunity to work in a few industries including retail, manufacturing, and food service. After I finished my undergrad degree, I continued to explore different industries including the financial, new home building, and investments industries.
            I have a passion for music and participated in my high school and college marching band programs where I held a leadership position for a total of 6 years. I also competed in a couple world class indoor drumlines from Louisville Kentucky and Indianapolis Indiana. I also discovered a passion for photography 
            and photo editing and spend a lot of my free time working on honing my craft. See some of the hobbies I love below.
